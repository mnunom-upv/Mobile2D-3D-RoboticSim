# Mobile2D-3D-RoboticSim
## _A mobile 2D and 3D robotic simulator for STEAM education_

- We first developed a low-cost educational robotic platform for a line-following robot based on an on-board computer, sensors, and actuators
- Simultaneously, we developed an Android-based mobile application integrating a remote control module and two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulators

## Features

- The user can use the app without having the low-cost robotic platform (online and offline modes)
- When available, the app can integrate the platform by paring it using WiFi
- No Internet connection is required for using the simulators in offline mode


## Software Used:

Mobile2D-3D-RoboticSim required the use and integration of the following open source projects:

- [AndroidStudio] - Android Studio: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development.
- [Java] - Programming language used for developing Android apps.
- [OpenGL ES (OpenGL for Embedded Systems) ] - OpenGL ES is a  cross-platform graphics API designed for embedded devices such as Smartphones and tablets among others. 
- [Blender] - An open-source 3D creation suite to create the 3D models used by the Mobile2D-3D-RoboticSim

## Installation
